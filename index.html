            <p>What is Frontend</p>
            <P>Front-end web development, also known as
            client-side development is the practice
            of producing <em>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</em> for a website
            or Web Application so that a user can see and interact
            with them directly. The challenge associated with 
            front end development is that the tools and techniques used to 
            create the front end of a website change constantly and so the 
            developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.</P>
